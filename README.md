#Chapman Robotics Club Self-Driving Car

This is the Chapman Robotics 2016-2017 project. We are using a [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-3-model-b/) in conjunction with the [SunFounder Smart Video Car Kit](https://www.sunfounder.com/rpi-car.html) and other assorted parts to construct a miniature self-driving car.

### Goal
To develop a self-driving car capable of following road lines, obeying signs, and avoiding obstacles.

### Method
Using Python, and the camera included with our kit, we will develop neural networks to implement object recognition and discretionary responses.

### License
To be determined.
